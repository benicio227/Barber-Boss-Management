## About the Project

The **Barber Boss Management API** is a management system for barbershops developed in **.NET 8**, using a layered architecture and following the **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** concept. The project allows barbershop owners to log in, register their barbershops, and record monthly revenues in a simple and efficient way.

The main features include **CRUD** operations for users, barbershops, and revenues. The database structure consists of three tables: Revenue, which is linked to a barbershop; Barbershop, which is associated with a user; and the system's user table.

Data is stored in a **MySQL** database, and the project's architecture is based on **REST**, providing efficient interaction between the client and server. The API comes with documentation automatically generated by **Swagger**, making it easier for developers to integrate and test, as well as making the exploration of the API more intuitive. To facilitate development, NuGet packages like **AutoMapper** were used for mapping domain objects and request/response models, reducing the need for repetitive code; **FluentValidation**, which implements validation rules in a simple and intuitive way for request models, keeping the code clean and maintainable; and **FluentAssertions**, used in unit tests to make verifications more readable and help write clear, understandable tests. Additionally, **Entity Framework** acts as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that simplifies database interactions, allowing the use of .NET objects to manipulate data directly, without the need to write SQL queries.

### Features

- **Domain Driven Design (DDD)**: Modular structure that facilitates understanding and maintaining the domain of the application.
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests with FluentAssertions to ensure functionality and quality.
- **Report Generation**: Ability to export detailed reports to **PDF** and **Excel**, offering a visual and effective analysis of expenses.
- **RESTful API with Swagger Documentation**: A documented interface that facilitates integration and testing for developers.

### Feature in Development

- PDF Report Generation: The functionality to export detailed reports to PDF is in the implementation phase and may not work correctly at the moment. Future updates will include fixing this feature.
